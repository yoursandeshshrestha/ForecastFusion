Building a weather app using JavaScript is a great project to showcase your skills, but you're right that adding some complexity can make it stand out more on your resume. Here are some ideas to enhance your weather app:

    User Authentication: Implement user authentication so users can sign up, log in, and save their favorite locations or customize their experience.

    Geolocation: Allow the app to detect the user's location automatically using geolocation APIs, or let users search for weather information in different locations.

    Responsive Design: Ensure your app works well on various devices, from desktops to tablets and smartphones, by implementing responsive design principles.

    Data Visualization: Use libraries like D3.js or Chart.js to create interactive and visually appealing charts or graphs displaying weather data trends over time.

    Forecast Accuracy: Integrate multiple weather APIs to compare forecasts and provide users with the most accurate and up-to-date information.

    Push Notifications: Implement push notifications to alert users about severe weather conditions or changes in the forecast for their saved locations.

    Offline Support: Utilize service workers and local storage to enable offline access to cached weather data and provide a seamless user experience even when the internet connection is unreliable.

    Unit Conversion: Allow users to switch between different units of measurement (e.g., Celsius vs. Fahrenheit, mph vs. km/h) based on their preferences.

    Social Sharing: Enable users to share weather updates or forecasts on social media platforms, fostering engagement and expanding your app's reach.

    Advanced Weather Data: Include additional weather data such as UV index, air quality index, pollen count, or sunrise/sunset times for more comprehensive weather reports.

By incorporating some or all of these features into your weather app, you can demonstrate not only your proficiency in JavaScript but also your ability to create a polished and feature-rich application.
